# Data-wrangling
Data wrangling work 

4. Data Integration 
This part is work on Integration of Datasets with Python to develop a comprehensive dataset to match properties in different suburbs with train schedules and crime rate.

Two major parts are included in my work. 

One is data integration: unzip and storing files to selected folders, merge different datasets and select required data. 

The other is geometry part algorithm, which contains calculation of distance with Point and Polygon, matching train schedule with different suburbs on work days.
